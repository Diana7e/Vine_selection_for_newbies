# Vine_selection_for_newbies
This repository contains my final project for  Data Analytics Bootcamp.  I explored a Wine Reviews dataset and built an interactive Tableau dashboard to recommend wines for a novice based on price, rating, variety, and country. I also built a machine learning model to train it to rate wine like an experienced sommelier.
